2 Capital calls in 2 weeks! Ouch,https://www.biggerpockets.com/forums/432/topics/1117203-2-capital-calls-in-2-weeks-ouch,Solomon Rosenberg,Multi-Family and Apartment Investing,https://www.biggerpockets.com/users/solomonr5,"<p>Within the past 2 weeks I got 2 capital calls from different sponsors, I'm assuming that there are many deals in similar situations.<br><br>The sponsors are saying, If they have enough capital to bring occupancy to 90% they will have better options to refinance or sell. That's true, however what if they can't deliver on the occupancy in a short period. <br><br>They say it's not a good market to sell now. True again, but what if interest rates stay volatile for longer than expected, and the market stays locked up longer.<br><br>Meanwhile the property is bleeding 6 figures monthly, and the added capital will only go so far, unless there is a major change in the interest rates soon, and that doesn't seem likely.<br><br>They also say if we don't infuse more capital we may lose our principle too, as they will be forced to sell at a loss. That is possible, but this may end up happening anyway. <br><br>So, what's the call? Do I put more money into these deals, or do I accept a dilution of my shares and put my money elsewhere?<br><br>Here is the thing - our brains are wired to be more sensitive to a loss compared to the possibility of even a much larger gain and we are biased to try and stop a loss.<br><br>I think I need to take a step back and think about this like it's a totally new deal, and I have no stake in it, would I invest in this deal now based on all the facts?<br><br>What do you think?<br><br></p>"
Modular/prefab Home vs. Custom building options?,https://www.biggerpockets.com/forums/44/topics/1073539-modular-prefab-home-vs-custom-building-options,Lowell Bailey,Real Estate Development & New Home Construction,https://www.biggerpockets.com/users/lowellb1,"<p>Hi All,</p>,<p>My wife and I are planning to subdivide a property in Chittenden County, VT which will result in a 1.5-acre building lot.  Upon some initial research, it seems like a modular home might be the right option for us if we can achieve a high-enough quality and energy-efficiency standard.  Our goal is to build something that is energy-efficient but that we could sell in a few years for a profit.  Are their any recommendations on new construction practices and/or modular/prefab builders that find the balance between energy-efficiency and value?  Specifically, we would want to be able to list the home for sale in 2-3 years and have it appreciate in value so that our basis is less than our sales price (less real estate commission)?  I have heard that it's hard to make a profit on new builds so I'm wondering if anyone has experience in this area and would be willing to share their thoughts.</p>,<p>Thanks in advance.</p>,<p>-LB<br></p>"

Can I sublet a unit when I have no lease? ,https://www.biggerpockets.com/forums/52/topics/1150188-can-i-sublet-a-unit-when-i-have-no-lease,Joycel Portela,General Landlording & Rental Properties,https://www.biggerpockets.com/users/joycelp,"<p>Hi everyone!</p>,<p>I'm currently living in a townhouse which was originally leased to my father in law 10 years ago. He was never asked to sign a lease renewal and now I've been living there 2 years paying the rent while he moved away for work. He just informed me that he doesn't plan to move back and I'm considering to move out as well, but I'm hoping to sublet to make additional income.  However, the owner is not aware that I've been the one paying the rent and living there. Although the original lease does not impede subleasing, I'm afraid if he finds out that my father in law is no longer living there, that the rent will be increased to market value, which is crazy pricey in Miami and would defeat the idea I have to sublet.</p>,<p>I don't know how to go about this!  I'm assuming subleasing is allowed since it's not specified on the original lease, but since I'm not part of that lease I fear being held liable if I were to move someone in and then they refuse to leave or end up not paying the rent, etc. Any guidance on how to go about this would be greatly appreciated.</p>,<p>Thank you in advance! </p>"

Per the survey we are missing an acre of property and our survey company is saying that the acre belongs to the neighbors. After speaking with the seller he said that is incorrect. He had a mobile home and a barn on the one acre property that his son lived  in  from 2011-2018. Prior to that his father owned the property from 1984 till he inherited it in 2014. Prior to that his grandfather purchased it in 1920. SO the property has been in the family since 1920. <br>We are thinking about doing tacking adverse possession. But the person who sold the property did not use the property for the last 6 years. He would go to the property from time to time to put things in the barn or in the mobile home. He still paid taxes on the property. <br>Would we still have a good case for AP? Everything that I have read says ""continuous use""</p>"

I personally invest in Panama City Beach, Pawleys Island, Tybee Island, Asheville and Avon, NC. The only one out of those markets that has some potential to hit those numbers is Avon, NC but I would say that is a stretch. I think 500k can get you around 70k with the right property in Avon but that is probably the max. The other markets not really possible or close. I had been looking in Blue Ridge, Bryson City and Gatlinburg but also looks like not even close. Recently I've been making offers and found these two properties right around 500k that each did over 100k in rental income last year. The first one has an <abbr title=""Homeowners Association"" data-abbreviation='{""pattern"":""HOA"",""description"":""Homeowners Association"",""url"":null,""link_label"":null}'>HOA</abbr> that is changing the rules to not allow Short Term Rentals anymore and the second one had 6 offers and I didn't get it.

I spent a couple years while in the military on a team to renovate the building my unit was using (25,000 sq.ft. building with offices, restrooms, etc.). I've helped numerous friends with their home renovation projects, from concrete to decks, to windows, siding, roofing; the list goes on. And unlike work (which IS a four-letter word) at my W-2 job, I genuinely enjoy building and fixing things. I also like helping people. </p>,<p>Just posting today to get my name out there and see if the BP community has any advice on servicing this niche. </p>,<p>Do you think it's a tenable idea? </p>,<p>How would I build a clientele? </p>,<p>What are potential pitfalls? </p>,<p>How to market quality over quantity?</p>,<p>How would you start up a business like this?</p>,<p>Anyway, thanks for reading and offering any advice.

Hower, it seems really over saturated so not sure if I should still look there</p>,<p>2) NC -  I'm drawn to this state but am not as familiar with the cities.  Looked at the Wilmington area but open to any suggestions</p>,<p>3) NY - upstate, NYC or even far out in LI (mastic Beach?).  It's my home state but property and taxes are so expensive outside of the city and in NYC you're dealing with maintenance fees, boards etc. I just think my money will go further elsewhere</p>,<p>3) Maine - I'm drawn here because eventually I want a second home in this state but this is my heart talking, not my brain<br><br>My question is, how did you go about deciding where you to invest? What resources did you use? Who did you talk to initially?  Does anyone have feedback on any of the areas I listed above? Are there other areas I should consider?  I realize this is incredibly broad, so I apologize but I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed.  Once I narrow it down, I feel like I will move but right now I'm stuck.
